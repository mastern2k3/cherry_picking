Roses are red
Violets are blue
I've never found someone as patient
As you

Roses are red
Violets are blue
If you get lost
Then I'll look for you

Roses are red
Violets are blue
You know I'm always sorry
When I hurt you

Roses are red 
Violets are blue
If you don't believe me
Then what else can I do
